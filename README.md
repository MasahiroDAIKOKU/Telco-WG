# OpenChain Telco Work Group
Welcome to the OpenChain Telco Work Group.

We are creating an [OpenChain Telco SBOM specification](https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/Telco-WG/blob/main/OpenChain%20Telco%20SBOM%20Specification.md) that is still in draft version.

There is a [Japanese transation of the specification](https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/Telco-WG/blob/main/OpenChain%20Telco%20SBOM%20Specification_JP.md) that was provided by Masahiro DAIKOKU-san from KDDI Corporation.

Our mailing list is here:

We welcome contributions via the list, via our calls and here on GitHub.

Our regular calls are the first Thursday of each month. You can find the event in the global OpenChain calendar: https://www.openchainproject.org/community

We host two meeting each time, one in the morning European time and one in the afternoon European time. This to ensure that we can have as diverse a set of participants as possible from different time zones.
