## Meetings

Our regular calls are the first Thursday of each month. You can find the event in the global OpenChain calendar: [https://www.openchainproject.org/community](https://openchainproject.org/participate)

We host two meeting each time, one in the morning European time and one in the afternoon European time. This to ensure that we can have as diverse a set of participants as possible from different time zones.

## OpenChain Telco SBOM Guide

We have created an [OpenChain Telco SBOM Guide](https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/Telco-WG/blob/main/OpenChain-Telco-SBOM-Guide_EN.md) that is now in version 1.0.

There is a [Japanese translation of the guide](https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/Telco-WG/blob/main/OpenChain-Telco-SBOM-Guide_JP.md) that was provided by Masahiro DAIKOKU-san from KDDI Corporation.

There is a [French translation of the guide](https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/Telco-WG/blob/main/OpenChain-Telco-SBOM-Guide_FR.md) that was provided by Marc-Etienne Vargenau from Nokia.

There is a [Chinese translation of the guide](https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/Telco-WG/blob/main/OpenChain-Telco-SBOM-Guide_ZH_HANS.md) that was provided by David Liu from Bytedance.

## Tools

Nokia has provided a [Python tool](tools) to validate an SBOM against the OpenChain Telco SBOM Guide.
