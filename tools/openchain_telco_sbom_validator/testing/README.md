# Testing the validator

Is based on https://thorsteinssonh.github.io/bash_test_tools/
I'm not sure if this is the best way, but I just store a copy of [bash_test_tools](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thorsteinssonh/bash_test_tools/master/bash_test_tools) in the test folder.

## Pre-requisits

* sudo apt-get install strace
* There should be a Pyhton virtual environment in the `.env` folder with all the pre-requicits of the `nokia-sbom-validator` installed
